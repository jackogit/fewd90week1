  <h1>ALL ABOUT JACK</h1>

  <img src="images/img_5404.jpeg">

 
 	<p>Originally born in Texas, the son of an Air Force aviator, my family moved extensively around the country for most of my childhood.  Not many families relocate like the military ones that I have known.  It is not uncommon to live in one area for 2-3 years, then transfer to an altogether different locale.  This cultural and social change is typically hard for younger kids as they neither grow up having an emotional anchor, nor there own social network.</p>

 	<p>Regardless, my young adulthood had me attend an exclusive all male college and afer spending time in the U.S. Navy, made my mark in the engineering field for a number of years.  Within this time frame, I learned of myself that I was not happy sitting in a cubicle day after day, week after week, working 60 hours per week for a huge impersonal corporation.  Politics and nepotism were rampant.  This affected my desire to head back out to sea where I thrived.</p>

 	<p>Ocean going life is great for the individual that does not desire ties to the mainland, but as Dunne said, "No man is a island" and I needed to come back to shore to reestablish my partriachy over my family that I had started, but left to ply my trade.</p>

 	<p>The ensuing years up to now have resulted in my starting a business and developing that.  Bootstrapping my corporation with employees has opened many doors for me and taught me a lot about my limitations. I still have insecurities, but everyone does.  I am older now.  My kids are adults.  My wife is an ex-.  I am about refocusing my life around being happy on a daily basis.</p>

 	<p>Taking courses to enhance a skill I have always envied others pursuing, I find myself at a new path in life and with a little fortune, hope to enable an income as well as help others in the pursuit of their dreams.<p>

 	<p>You find in me a loyal and very dedicated man.  Subservient, but independent.  Cool under fire.  A great listener and lover of all things romantic and noble.</p>
